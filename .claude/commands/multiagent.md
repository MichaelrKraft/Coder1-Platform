# Multi-Agent Task Execution

Coordinate multiple specialized subagents to work on complex tasks. This command intelligently delegates work to the most appropriate agents based on the task description.

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Phase

First, let me analyze this task and determine which specialized agents should be involved:

1. **Task Breakdown**: Understanding what needs to be done
2. **Agent Selection**: Choosing the right experts
3. **Execution Plan**: Coordinating the work

## Available Agents:

### React IDE Specialist
- IDE configuration, special views, terminal integration
- React components and TypeScript development

### API Route Developer  
- Express.js routes and RESTful endpoints
- Service integration and response formatting

- Auto-commit configuration

### Code Quality Guardian
- Code review for simplicity and best practices
- Bug prevention through minimal changes

### Documentation Maintainer
- README and CLAUDE.md updates
- Keeping docs synchronized with code

## Execution Strategy

Based on the task "$ARGUMENTS", I will:

1. **Identify Primary Agent**: Determine which agent should lead based on the main focus
2. **Support Agents**: Identify which other agents need to assist
3. **Coordinate Work**: Ensure all changes follow our principles:
   - Simplicity above all
   - Minimal code changes
   - No lazy solutions
   - Thorough testing

## Starting Multi-Agent Workflow

Now delegating to the appropriate specialized agents to complete this task efficiently while maintaining code quality...
