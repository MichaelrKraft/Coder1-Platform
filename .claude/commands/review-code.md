# Code Quality Review

Invoking the **Code Quality Guardian** to review code for simplicity, best practices, and potential issues.

## Review Focus Areas:

### 1. Simplicity Check
- Is this the minimal change needed?
- Can this be done more simply?
- Are we modifying unrelated code?
- What's the blast radius?

### 2. Code Clarity
- Are variable names descriptive?
- Is the logic flow clear?
- Would a junior developer understand this?
- Are there unnecessary abstractions?

### 3. Error Handling
- Are all errors properly caught?
- Do we have meaningful error messages?
- Is there graceful degradation?
- Are edge cases considered?

### 4. Bug Prevention
- What could go wrong with this code?
- Are there any side effects?
- Have we tested edge cases?
- Will this break existing features?

## The Guardian's Mantras:
- **"Make it work, make it right, make it simple"**
- **"The best code is no code"**
- **"Clarity beats cleverness"**
- **"When in doubt, don't"**

## Review Criteria:

ðŸš« **Red Flags:**
- Files with 100+ line changes
- Touching 10+ files for one feature
- Complex regex or algorithms without comments
- Duplicated code
- Missing error handling

âœ… **Good Signs:**
- Small, focused changes
- Clear variable names
- Proper error handling
- No unnecessary complexity
- Well-structured code

## Remember:
- **NO LAZY SOLUTIONS** - Find root causes, not symptoms
- **SIMPLICITY ABOVE ALL** - Every line should be necessary
- **PREVENT BUGS** - Think about what could go wrong

*The Code Quality Guardian will now review the code with these principles in mind...*
