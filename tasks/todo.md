## Progress Notes

Starting implementation of specialized subagents for Coder1-Platform...

All subagents implemented successfully!

## Review Summary

### Changes Made:

1. **Created 7 Specialized Subagents** in `.claude/agents/`:
   - **React IDE Specialist** - Handles IDE configuration, special views, and React components
   - **API Route Developer** - Creates and maintains Express.js API endpoints
   - **Frontend UI/UX Designer** - Manages glassmorphism design and CSS architecture
   - **Electron Integration Expert** - Handles desktop app issues and macOS workarounds
   - **Git Workflow Manager** - Manages version control and auto-commit workflows
   - **Code Quality Guardian** - Reviews code for simplicity and best practices
   - **Documentation Maintainer** - Keeps docs synchronized and well-organized

### Benefits Achieved:

1. **Improved Development Speed**
   - Each subagent handles its specialty without context pollution
   - Parallel expertise available on-demand
   - Focused assistance for specific tasks

2. **Enhanced Code Quality**
   - Code Quality Guardian enforces simplicity
   - Specialized knowledge prevents common mistakes
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

3. **Better Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Each subagent has defined responsibilities
   - Easier to maintain and extend

### How to Use:

Simply mention the subagent by name or let Claude Code automatically delegate based on context. For example:
- "Ask the React IDE Specialist about the terminal buttons"
- "Have the API Route Developer create a new endpoint"
- "Get the Code Quality Guardian to review this change"

### Technical Details:

- All subagents stored in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Each has YAML frontmatter defining name, description, and tools
- System prompts provide specialized knowledge and guidelines
- Tool access limited to what each role needs

The subagents are now ready to assist with development, each bringing specialized expertise while maintaining the core principles of simplicity and quality.
