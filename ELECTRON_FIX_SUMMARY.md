# Electron White Screen Fix Summary

## Problem
The Electron app showed a white screen because it was trying to load `http://localhost:3000`, but the Express server couldn't actually serve HTTP requests due to the macOS Node.js networking issue.

## Solution
Modified the Electron app to serve files directly instead of relying on HTTP:

### 1. Created `electron-server.js`
- Runs Express app inside Electron process
- Handles API requests without using network stack
- Converts Express routes to Electron-compatible handlers

### 2. Updated `electron-main.js`
- Removed Node.js server spawning
- Uses `loadFile()` instead of `loadURL()`
- Maps routes to actual HTML files
- Sets up protocol handlers for API requests

### 3. Added `electron-api-bridge.js`
- Intercepts fetch() calls in the frontend
- Routes API calls through Electron's protocol
- Provides mock responses for testing

### 4. Updated HTML files
- Added electron-api-bridge.js script
- Ensures API calls work in Electron environment

## How to Use

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start Coder1 in Electron
npm start
```

The app now:
- Loads HTML files directly from disk
- Handles API calls within Electron process
- Bypasses the macOS networking issue completely
- Shows the Smart PRD Generator on launch

## Navigation
- Use menu bar to navigate between views
- File → New Project to start fresh
- View → IDE to access the code editor
- AI → Start Infinite Loop for code generation

## Next Steps
1. Complete API bridge implementation for all endpoints
2. Test all features work correctly in Electron
3. Add proper error handling for missing files
4. Implement WebSocket support for real-time features
