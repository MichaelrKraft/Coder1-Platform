# Electron App Fixes - January 26, 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Voice Feature ✅
**Problem**: The Smart PRD Generator was missing the speech-to-text functionality
**Solution**: Created `/static/smart-prd-voice.js` with:
- Full speech recognition implementation
- Microphone buttons added to all text inputs
- Visual feedback when recording
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic detection of new inputs (for modals/dynamic content)

### 2. IDE Navigation Not Working ✅
**Problem**: "Enter Coder1 IDE" button did nothing when clicked
**Solution**: Updated `/static/electron-api-bridge.js` with:
- Navigation handler for Electron's file:// protocol
- Automatic override of IDE button click handlers
- Support for menu navigation (View → IDE)
- Proper path resolution for file-based navigation

## How to Test

1. **Restart the Electron app**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f electron
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Voice Input**:
   - Click "Start Building" in the PRD Generator
   - Look for microphone icons in text fields
   - Click microphone to start voice input
   - Speak your text
   - Click microphone again to stop

3. **Test IDE Navigation**:
   - Click "Enter Coder1 IDE" button
   - Or use menu: View → IDE
   - Should load the IDE interface

## Technical Details

### Voice Implementation
- Uses Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)
- Gracefully degrades if not supported
- Continuous listening with interim results
- Automatic text insertion and cursor positioning
- CSS animations for visual feedback

### Navigation Fix
- Intercepts navigation in Electron environment
- Converts web paths to file:// URLs
- Works with both buttons and menu items
- Maintains proper relative paths

## Files Modified
1. Created: `/static/smart-prd-voice.js` - Voice recognition module
2. Updated: `/static/electron-api-bridge.js` - Added navigation handling
3. Updated: `smart-prd-generator.html` - Already had script includes
4. Updated: `ide-build/index.html` - Already had electron bridge include

## Next Steps
- Test all features thoroughly
- Consider adding voice commands for navigation
- Add keyboard shortcuts for voice input
- Implement full API bridge for all backend calls
